In the same pan, cook the mushrooms until they are brown and dry. Roll out the puff pastry, and layer prosciutto, mushrooms, and mustard on top of it. Place the beef fillet in the center of the pastry and fold the pastry over the top, tucking in the edges.

Pour hot water into the baking dish until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the custard is set. Chill the custard in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Sprinkle sugar over the top of each custard, and use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar until it is golden brown and crackly.",
